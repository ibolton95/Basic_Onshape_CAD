# Basic_Onshape_CAD
## Base 
I am trying to figure out my settings in Onshape along with the keyboard shortcuts in order to use Onshape as effectively as I can. I didn't use many keyboard shortcuts for this part, but I can see how they will be helpful for future assignments once I get the hang of them.

## Mount
I am still getting a hold of the keyboard shortcuts, but I am feeling more comfortable with pressing "r" for a quick rectangle and "c" for circle.

## Fork
The fillets and chamfers were easy enough, and, as before, I am trying to be able to quickly perform the keyboard shortcuts.

## Tire
I made the tire without any trouble, but I did have to spend a little extra time looking for some of the features just because I am working on a half-screen. But that is not a significant issue, and the rotation went smoothly.
