# Basic_Onshape_CAD
## Base 
I am trying to figure out my settings in Onshape along with the keyboard shortcuts in order to use Onshape as effectively as I can. I didn't use many keyboard shortcuts for this part, but I can see how they will be helpful for future assignments once I get the hang of them.

## Mount
I am still getting a hold of the keyboard shortcuts, but I am feeling more comfortable with pressing "r" for a quick rectangle and "c" for circle.

## Fork
The fillets and chamfers were easy enough, and, as before, I am trying to be able to quickly perform the keyboard shortcuts.

## Tire
I made the tire without any trouble, but I did have to spend a little extra time looking for some of the features just because I am working on a half-screen. But that is not a significant issue, and the rotation went smoothly.

## Wheel
The first time I tried making the wheel, some of the lines in my first sketch were not fully defined when they were supposed to be. I looked for what I did wrong and found out I made one of my dimensions incorrectly. After that, I was able to make the wheel without any trouble.

## Axle, Collar, and Bearings
All of the parts were easy enough to make - the fact that a new part can be made directly on an old one makes the process easier and quicker, which is nice.

## Sub-Assembly
A couple of times, I was not sure if I selected the correct mate connectors because it highlights the entire part when a connector is selected, but it worked out and I had no trouble creating the sub-assembly.

## Final Assembly
My fork was not wide enough to fit my axle, bearing, and collar, so I had to measure the distance of the the parts and then adjust the width of the fork. I also had a little bit of trouble with the parrallel mates, but I figured everything out and my assembly looks good.

## Onshape Challenge
The creation of the parts went smoothly (except that I incorrectly dimensioned a circle, but it was an easy fix). I had some trouble with the mates in the assembly, but once I figured out how to use a revolute and cylindrical mate, I correclty assembled the part.

## Dorothy's Dowel Pins
I got the hang of these configurations pretty easily, and the creation of the frame went smoothly as well. It's nice that configurations are made so accessible on onshape, and the list feature is great.
